## Product Requirements
 - User Authentication: The login screen must have a mechanism to authenticate users' identy to ensure only authorized users can access the application. Because I am not using a local database, I have hard coded a Demo login and password for the time being. 
 - User Feedback: If the user fails their login attempt, the login screen should provide feedback to the user on the status of their login attempt. 
 - User Experience: The login screen should be designed to provide a positive user experience with clear and intuitive interface elements that make the login process simple and efficient.
